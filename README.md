- Visualize key findings using clear and informative charts

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Facebook Prophet)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

- Identified top-selling products and peak sales periods
- Discovered customer segments based on purchase behavior
- Built predictive models for revenue forecasting
